## Instructions

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
* Once the game ends a modal will appear, containing the total timer the player took to finish the game.
* The user can click the restart button to restart the game.
